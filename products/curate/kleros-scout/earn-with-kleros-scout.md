# Earn With Kleros Scout

## 1. Challenges: Earn Bounties by detecting erroneous entries

* Submitters must deposit funds (e.g., xDai) to list an entry (e.g., a token).
* If you find an invalid or malicious submission that doesn’t comply with the registry policy, you can challenge it by staking a deposit and escalating it to Kleros Court.
* If jurors rule in your favor, you will earn a portion of the submitter’s deposit as a bounty.

💡 Example: Challenge a token that falsely claims to have an audit and earn a reward.\

⚠️Risk Note: Incorrect challenges will result in the loss of your deposit.

## 2. Reward Programs: Earn rewards by adding new entries&#x20;

* Periodic Incentives: Kleros and partner projects run campaigns to reward contributors for adding high-quality entries (e.g., submitting tokens or contracts on specific chains).
