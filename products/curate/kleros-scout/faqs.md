## What is the difference between Kleros Curate and Kleros Scout?

Kleros Scout is a specialized branch of Kleros Curate.

* Kleros Curate can be used to verify all types of assets, including real-world assets, traditional finance (TradFi), real-estates, stocks and more. Partners can integrate Curate with their own rules and policies.
* Kleros Scout is fully focused on decentralized verification of on-chain assets like smart contracts, tokens, and domains

## I see the same entries on both Kleros Scout and Kleros Curate. Is this normal?

Yes, this is completely normal.

Kleros Scout retrieves data from Kleros [Curate](https://curate.kleros.io/), but focuses only on selected registries related to Web3 instruments.\
On these selected registries, you can interact with entries from either platform, depending on your preference.

## **Is Kleros Scout free to use?**

Browsing and verifying entries is completely free.

However, submitting or challenging entries requires staking a deposit. This deposit discourages spam and ensures high-quality participation. If your submission is valid or your challenge succeeds, you get your deposit back.

## **I discovered fraudulent activity from an entry that is already included in one of the registries. Can I remove this entry from Kleros Scout?**

Yes! Even accepted entries can be removed if they later become fraudulent or non-compliant.

To request removal:

* Gather evidence proving the entry no longer meets the registry's rules.
* Submit a removal request via the registry interface.
* If challenged, the case may go to Kleros Court for final decision.

## **Can I earn rewards by participating in Kleros Scout?**

Yes! You can earn in two ways:

* Adding new entries – Some registries have reward programs that pay for high-quality submissions.
* Challenging incorrect entries – If you successfully challenge a fraudulent entry, you earn a portion of the submitter's deposit as a bounty.
