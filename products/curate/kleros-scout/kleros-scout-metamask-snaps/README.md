# Kleros Scout - Metamask Snaps

Started in 2019 with the Tokens registry, [Kleros](https://kleros.io/?ref=blog.kleros.io) has been a pioneer in curating decentralised registries, especially around security metadata.&#x20;

We now introduce Kleros Scout, a [Metamask Snap](https://metamask.io/snaps/) designed to enable safe contract interactions by providing insights, curated and secured by the community!

The Kleros Scout Snap utilises information from the following Kleros Curate registries:

* [**Address Tags registry**](https://curate.kleros.io/tcr/100/0x66260C69d03837016d88c9877e61e08Ef74C59F2) of verified project and name tag of contracts
* [**Contract-Domain Name registry**](https://curate.kleros.io/tcr/100/0x957A53A994860BE4750810131d9c876b2f52d6E1) of verified contract-to-domain name pairings
* [**Tokens registry**](https://curate.kleros.io/tcr/100/0xeE1502e29795Ef6C2D60F8D7120596abE3baD990) of ERC-20 tokens

## 2. How to use the Snap's features?

Once you install the Kleros Scout Snap, with every txn/contract interaction, you will see a tab which provides you with insights around the same. Upon installation, If you see this, you are already using community curated contract insights for secure dapp interaction - the most important feature of the Kleros Scout Snap.

## 3. What does the Kleros Scout Snap do?

This Snap pulls contract metadata from Kleros's decentralized token curated registries (TCRs) to provide insights around the contract you are interacting with.

## 4. What does the Snap not do?

The Kleros Scout snap **does not**:

→ Endorse any contract interaction

→ Do any centralised whitelisting - all data is community curated. To know more about the same, go to ‘How is the registry data curated?’.

_→_ Guarantee 100% accuracy or take on any liability caused as a result of an insight.

## 5. What decentralised registries by Kleros are used for this Snap?
