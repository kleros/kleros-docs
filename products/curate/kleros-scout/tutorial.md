   * To check how to appeal cases go to [Kleros Court](../../court/) and follow the procedure&#x20;

## D. Removing a Confirmed Entry

Some projects or contracts may initially seem legitimate but engage in fraudulent behavior after being listed. Even if an entry has been accepted and is part of the registry, it can still be removed if fraudulent activity is later detected . The registry is designed to remain a safe place and provide ongoing protection.

2. Locate the Entry:
   * Find the already included entry that you suspect of being fraudulent.
   * Select it by pressing "Details" button.
3. Compare the Entry with the Policy:
   * Check if it still meets the registry’s rules
   * If discrepancies exist, start gathering evidence.
4. Submit a Removal Request:
   * Once you have enough proof, press the "Remove Entry" button.
   * Fill out the challenge form with as much evidence as possible.
5. Provide Strong Evidence:
   * Your submission will be reviewed by the Court, so accuracy is critical.
   * Ensure you submit complete and clear information.
6. Complete the Transaction:
   * Make sure you have enough funds in the required token for the challenge deposit.
   * Press 'Confirm' to submit your challenge through your wallet.
