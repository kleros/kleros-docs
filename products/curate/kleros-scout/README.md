## What Is Kleros Scout?

Kleros Scout is an extension of Kleros Curate. The difference?

* **Kleros Curate** can verify information about any type of asset (real estate, on-chain assets, stocks, articles, fake news, etc.). Anyone can create new registries with their own rules.
* **Kleros Scout** focuses on verifying key information about on-chain assets (such as smart contracts, tokens, and domains) to help users avoid scams and fraudulent activity.

Both platforms share the same decentralized mechanism, using crowd intelligence for data verification.

As a part of Curate, Kleros Scout is fully decentralized. No central authority controlling or filtering which assets can be included. All its data is transparent and open for anyone to verify. It is entirely run by crowd intelligence.

See more about differences in [FAQ](faqs.md)

## Why it is Safe

Since Scout is part of Curate, it uses the exact same mechanism to ensure safety.

#### PREVENTION

* **Submitting new entries:** Users must place a deposit. If they provide fraudulent information, they will lose money.
* **Challenging submissions** : Similarly, if someone claims an entry is non-compliant, they must place a deposit. If they raise unnecessary or incorrect challenges, they risk losing their deposit.

The community verifies submissions and challenges 24/7, also driven by [reward and bounty mechanisms.](earn-with-kleros-scout.md)

#### DISPUTE RESOLUTION: How Challenges Are Handled

Once an item is challenged, it goes directly to the [Kleros Court](../../court/), where impartial jurors analyze evidence and ensure the correct outcome for the submission.

## Why Scout is Important

Scams and errors can happen (too) often on blockchain. By using the crowd‚Äôs collective knowledge, Kleros Scout helps label or remove suspicious asset information before they can mislead users.

* Stops fake tokens, phishing websites, and risky contracts.
* No single company controls it. It is fully decentralized.
* Suspicious submissions are double-checked using Kleros Court.

## Current registries&#x20;

Kleros Scout currently curates information about the following items:

* Address Tags:  It certifies the association between public name tags and contract addresses.
  * [Single tags](https://app.klerosscout.eth.limo/#/?registry=Single_Tags).
  * [ATQ(Address Tag Query)](https://app.klerosscout.eth.limo/#/?registry=Tags_Queries): A more efficient way to populate the registry. Allows submitters to define ownership of multiple addresses under the same entity via a single submission.
* [Contract-Domain Name registry](https://app.klerosscout.eth.limo/#/?registry=CDN) : verified contract-to-domain name pairings.&#x20;
* [Tokens registry](https://app.klerosscout.eth.limo/#/?registry=Tokens)&#x20;

üí° Remember: Scout shares registries with Kleros Curate, meaning all registries are accessible from both platforms. Scout provides a dedicated experience for on-chain assets.
