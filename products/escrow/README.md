**Kleros Escrow** is a secure and decentralized escrow Dapp that can be used for any exchange of goods, assets, or services involving an Ethereum-based asset.

Using Kleros Escrow, you can transact in the blockchain ecosystem for services, products, and assets with a simple solution that provides a level of trust not yet known outside the traditional commerce space. If a dispute happens, it will be adjudicated by crowdsourced jurors selected and incentivized by the Kleros protocol.

Whether you're a marketing company looking to offer trust to your clients by providing high-quality advertising services backed with dispute resolution, or a freelancer seeking payment protection for your work, Kleros Escrow provides the solution.

Both parties can benefit from a non-biased smart contract that securely holds funds. Service providers can deliver services knowing that funds have been deposited in escrow. Conversely, buyers can agree to deals knowing that if the service is not delivered as promised, they have recourse to dispute resolution.

## The Problem solved by Kleros Escrow

Anyone who's worked in the crypto ecosystem will be aware of the huge amount of services promoted daily. Whether through Telegram, email, or LinkedIn, you are likely to receive multiple unsolicited offers each day. How to sort the good from the bad, how to add trust to these potentially great marketing deals?

These offers range from simple content creation or reviews of your project, all the way to expensive exchange listing offers. In between, there's a plethora of other services including freelancing work, community management, bounty programs, and development work.

One key mechanism has been mostly absent from this sector:

> A trust backed escrow system to weed out the scammers from the legitimate offerings.

The blockchain ecosphere still lacks adequate decentralized dispute resolution processes. In turn, there are many projects who cater to their own arbitration needs using centralized procedures but these don't fit the decentralized ethos nor bring a true unbiased resolution to a disputed case.



Kleros aims to change that by using crowdsourced jurors to adjudicate common disputes that happen on the Internet.

> Employing a trust-backed escrow platform is a win-win situation:
>
> * Creates higher sales conversions for companies
> * Offers higher quality services and protection to consumers
> * Provides fair, decentralized dispute resolution when agreements break down
> * Eliminates the need for trusted third parties in transactions
