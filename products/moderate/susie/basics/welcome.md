  Susie's ability to welcome users to your group chat not only is polite, but it
  is an easy way to inform new members about the rules.

# Welcome

## Enabling Welcomes

To get started, you'll want to actually enable your welcomes. It's that easy.

## Captcha

Susie can use her greeting to help fight spam bots that may attempt to join your group chat. This setting mutes all new users until they engage a button to confirm they read the rules to unmute themselves. This can help prove they're not a bot!

### Admin Command

`/welcome`: toggles welcome message

`/captcha`: toggles captcha
