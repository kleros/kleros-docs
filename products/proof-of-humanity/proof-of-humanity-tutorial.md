# Proof of Humanity 2.0 Tutorial: (Register & Vouch)

## ✨ [<mark style="color:orange;">Proof of Humanity App</mark>](https://v2.poh.id/) ✨

To ensure a smooth and correct registration, make sure to follow the steps and read the Proof of Humanity Registration Policy carefully. Note that incorrect submissions will result in a profile challenge. 📌

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="1/ Register your profile" %}
### 1/ <mark style="color:orange;">Register your profile</mark>&#x20;

#### 1.a/ Go to the ✨ [<mark style="color:orange;">PoH v2</mark>](https://v2.poh.id/) ✨ dApp.

You will see the homepage of the app with the recent profiles registered in PoH.

#### 1.b/ '_Connect'_ your Web3 wallet

Once you’re on the registry page, click ‘<mark style="color:orange;">Connect</mark>_’_ in the upper right corner.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-07-25 at 10.50.01 AM.png>)

Once you click ‘<mark style="color:orange;">Connect</mark>’, this pop-up will appear. Select the wallet you want to connect.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-07-25 at 10.52.37 AM.png>)

Once you have successfully connected your wallet, you’ll see the ‘<mark style="color:orange;">Register</mark>’ button on the menu. Click '<mark style="color:orange;">Register</mark>' to formally begin the registration process. But before you proceed with the registration, make sure to read the Proof of Humanity Registry Policy. You can find the ‘<mark style="color:orange;">Policy</mark>’ button on the menu bar.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-07-25 at 11.01.18 AM.png" alt="" width="201"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you're done reading the policy, you are now ready to register. Click '<mark style="color:orange;">Register</mark>,' and you will be redirected to a new page where you need to fill out and confirm information to create your profile.\


_Before proceeding with the actual registration, take a look at the flowchart outlining the registration process:_

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/New profile (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



**1.c/ Click on '**<mark style="color:orange;">**Register**</mark>**' in the upper right corner.**

You can only see the '<mark style="color:orange;">Register</mark>' button if you have connected your wallet to the dApp.

If you don't see the '<mark style="color:orange;">Register</mark>' in the top menu bar, it means you are either not connected (check section 1.b again) or that you have already created a profile (you should see '<mark style="color:yellow;">PoH ID</mark>' instead).

{% hint style="danger" %}
**PRIVACY WARNING:** The wallet address you are using to submit your profile will be publicly linked to your identity. If you don't want your wallet holdings and transaction history to be linked to your identity, we recommend using a new address that you seeded with funds from an exchange.
{% endhint %}

### <mark style="color:orange;">I. INFORMATION</mark>

<picture><source srcset="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-07-25 at 11.20.37 AM.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (20) (1).png" alt=""></picture>

* **Step 1. Check Your Wallet Address:** Ensure it's the correct address you wish to associate with your PoH profile.
* **Step 2. Enter Your Display Name:** This can be an official name or the name by which you're commonly known.
* **Step 3. Consent Checkbox:** Carefully read and understand the statement about wallet association with your real identity. Check the box to agree.
* **Step 4. Proceed to Next:** Click the '_Next_' button to move forward.

### <mark style="color:orange;">II. PHOTO</mark>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-07-25 at 11.33.33 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Step 1. Photo Guidelines:** Read the recommendations for the type of photo to upload.
* **Step 2. ‘**_**Upload photo**_**’ or ‘**_**Take a Photo with Camera**_**’:** Use the app to upload or capture your photo. You can crop it if needed.
* **Step 3. Finalize Your Photo:** Click '_Ready_' once you're satisfied with the image or click '_Retake_' if you wish to change the photo.
* **Step 4. Continue:** Click '_Next_' to go to the next step.

{% hint style="success" %}
**TIP:** Browse through ‘_<mark style="color:green;">Resolved Claim</mark>_’ profiles (that means they have been accepted into the registry) to have examples of what correct profiles look like.
{% endhint %}

### <mark style="color:orange;">III. VIDEO</mark>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-07-25 at 11.50.00 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Step 1. ‘**_**Upload video**_**’ or ‘**_**Record a video with camera**_**’:** You can either upload an existing video or record a new one using the app.

{% hint style="info" %}
:pushpin: Your video must show you holding a sign with your wallet address (e.g., 0xFdc78b748d6Bc5f77892f6654ca73426a0D3b127) and saying the phrase:\
\
_"<mark style="color:orange;">**I certify that I am a real human and that I am not already registered in this registry**</mark>"._
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-07-25 at 11.55.24 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The sign can show the wallet address written or printed on paper, or have the wallet address displayed on a device screen. Make sure it is the same wallet address that you use for registration and that it is complete and readable.

* **Step 2. Review Your Video:** Make sure it meets the required criteria.
* **Step 3. Next Step:** Click '_Next_' to proceed.

### <mark style="color:orange;">IV. REVIEW & SUBMIT</mark>

* **Step 1. Double-Check Your Information:** Review all the details you've provided and revisit the [policy](https://cdn.kleros.link/ipfs/QmcEvNrofibGt1MQSCk7G1fFboiMyfHoYyns4En4kWG5hU) if necessary.
* **Step 2. Submission Deposit:** Enter the required deposit amount. Remember, this deposit is refunded after successful registration or lost in case of failure. Any amount you don't contribute now can be covered later.

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you have enough xDAI or ETH loaded in your wallet to pay for the deposit and transaction fee. If you don't have the amount for the deposit yet, you can pay the deposit later, but make sure you still have enough xDAI or ETH to cover the transaction fee.\
\
**WHAT IS THE SUBMITTER'S DEPOSIT?**&#x20;

The deposit is an amount you lock with the submission of your profile. It acts as an incentive for potential challengers to prove you are a fake or bot and also covers arbitration fees if a dispute is raised. If your profile goes through unchallenged and successfully registered, you’ll get your deposit back. If you are a fake or have provided incorrect information, someone can challenge your profile, and a dedicated Kleros dispute will be opened to rule on your case.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**COMPLIANCE WARNING:** The information you will submit about your profile will be checked and verified by the community to ensure you are not a bot or fake and that you complied with all the guidelines. Please read thoroughly the instructions given on the submit page and check out the full [Proof of Humanity Registration Policy](https://cdn.kleros.link/ipfs/QmcEvNrofibGt1MQSCk7G1fFboiMyfHoYyns4En4kWG5hU) to ensure the info you provide is correct.

You can only update information by withdrawing your profile and resubmitting it. There is no way to edit your profile (Evidences are there to argument that the case made against your profile is wrong, not to update your profile with a new video for example).

If you make a mistake in your submission (ex: Displaying a wrong address in the video), it could be interpreted as a malicious attack by the challengers verifying the entry into the registry and you could lose your deposit.\
Submissions are final and cannot be edited. Be sure to follow all submission rules to not lose your deposit.
{% endhint %}

* **Step 3. Submit Your Application:** Click the '_Submit_' button. Wait for the media to upload completely.
* **Step 4. Confirm the Transaction:** Once the upload is complete, confirm the transaction to finalise your registration.

Once the submission is successful, your profile will enter the '_<mark style="color:purple;">Vouching</mark>_' phase. Make sure to find a voucher and obtain at least one vouch, with your deposit paid in full, to proceed to the next phase of registration, the '_<mark style="color:blue;">Pending Claim</mark>_'.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/New profile.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Here's a simplified flowchart that provides an overview of the different registration phases.</p></figcaption></figure>

After successfully submitting your profile, your profile will initially be in the '_<mark style="color:purple;">Vouching</mark>_' status. To progress further, the following actions are required:

And here's a more comprehensive flowchart detailing the registration, challenging of profiles, revocation, and reapplying processes for PoH v2:

Don't forget to 🔔 [SUBSCRIBE](proof-of-humanity-tutorial.md#id-2-subscribe-to-notif) 🔔 to Profile Update Notifications to be informed of changes to your profile's status that require action.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="2/ Subscribe to Notif." %}
### 2/ <mark style="color:orange;">Subscribe to Profile Update Notifications</mark>

👷🏻‍♂️🚧 **Notification System Under Development** 🚧👷🏻‍♂️\
\
We're currently working on the notification for PoH v2. We appreciate your patience as we develop this feature. In the meantime, we recommend manually checking the progress of your profile to stay updated.\
\
Thank you for your understanding. Stay tuned for further updates!&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="3/ Profile Validation Process" %}
### 3/ <mark style="color:orange;">Watch your profile go through the validation process and finalize registration (</mark><mark style="color:orange;">**≈**</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">3-5 days)</mark>

Your submitted profile will start in '_<mark style="color:purple;">Vouching</mark>_**'** status and will go through a '_<mark style="color:blue;">Pending Claim</mark>_' phase before reaching the '_<mark style="color:green;">Resolved Claim</mark>_' status.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-08-29 at 3.52.57 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### 3.a/ How to go from '_<mark style="color:purple;">Vouching</mark>_' to '_<mark style="color:blue;">Pending Claim</mark>_<mark style="color:blue;">'</mark> status?

You need to find one person who is in '_<mark style="color:green;">Resolved Claim</mark>_' status and that knows you in real-life (or that can prove that you really are the person your profile describes) and ask that person to vouch for you.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-08-29 at 4.06.58 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This person will need to go to your profile page and click on the '<mark style="color:orange;">Vouch</mark>' button and sign a message from his wallet.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-02 at 1.26.20 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is the difference between 'Gasless Vouch' and 'Vouch'?**

The 'Gasless Vouch' is the recommended way of vouching for people without having to pay transaction fees. The vouch will be recorded and the vouched profile will be moved to the next phase when other profiles finalize their registration.

The 'Vouch' button is the old legacy way of vouching for someone with a transaction and its associated fee. We don't recommend using it except if you are the only vouched profile by your voucher and want to speed up the registration process.
{% endhint %}

Once a person has vouched for you, you will see it on your profile by checking the number of vouchers and the 'Vouched by' list.

{% hint style="success" %}
You cannot proceed to the '_<mark style="color:blue;">Pending Claim</mark>_' status unless you receive _<mark style="color:yellow;">**at least 1 vouch**</mark>_ and _<mark style="color:yellow;">**pay the full deposit**</mark>_. Make sure to complete these two important requirements so you can move forward in the registration process.
{% endhint %}

If you have the required number of vouchers, your deposit is at 100%, and you are the only current vouched profile by your voucher, your profile will be moved to '_<mark style="color:blue;">Pending Claim</mark>_' status quite soon.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why is my profile staying in '**_<mark style="color:purple;">**Vouching**</mark>_**' phase?** If you wonder why you still are not in '_<mark style="color:blue;">Pending Claim</mark>_' status even though you have your deposit and vouches, it probably means the person that vouched for you has vouched for several persons at the same time. His vouches are processed sequentially and you will need to wait for the persons he vouched for before you to be validated (3.5 days for each) before it is your turn for his vouch to be processed.
{% endhint %}

If you're still in the '_<mark style="color:purple;">Vouching</mark>_' phase and notice a mistake or need to make changes to your profile, you can do so by withdrawing your profile. However, the '<mark style="color:yellow;">Withdraw</mark>' option is only available during the vouching phase; once you've passed this phase, you will no longer have the option to withdraw.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-02 at 3.16.05 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### 3.b/ How to go from '_<mark style="color:blue;">Pending Claim</mark>_' to '_<mark style="color:green;">Resolved Claim</mark>_' status?

Once your Profile is in '_<mark style="color:blue;">Pending Claim</mark>_' status, it will go through a challenge period of 3.5 days. That means that during 3.5 days people will check your profile to verify if you are a fake or if you provided incorrect information and, if yes, will try to challenge your registration to win part of your deposit.

If you are not challenged during this period, you will be given the opportunity to transition to '_<mark style="color:green;">Resolved Claim</mark>_' status right after this 3.5 days period ends.

In order to finalize your registration, you will need to click on the '<mark style="color:yellow;">Execute</mark>_'_ button and confirm the transaction with your wallet. _(Note that any other address can also send this transaction for you)._

Once the transaction is validated, you will be in '_<mark style="color:green;">Resolved Claim</mark>_' status and you will have the capacity to vouch for other people. Your deposit will also be refunded at this time.

{% hint style="info" %}
**What if I am challenged?**

Then, a dispute will be created in Kleros Court.

\
You can provide evidence on your profile page to defend your case and monitor the progress of the dispute. Note that evidence is used to demonstrate that the reason for challenging the profile is or is not valid, it is not a tool to fix your submission mistakes.

You can also appeal when a ruling is given by jurors if you don't agree with it.

If the jury rules in your favor, your profile goes back to '_<mark style="color:blue;">Pending Claim</mark>_' phase for 3.5 days. If the jury rules in favor of the challenger, your profile goes to 'Expired' status.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="4/ Vouch for a profile" %}
### 4/ <mark style="color:orange;">Vouch for another profile</mark>

You can only vouch for another profile if you are connected to the app and your profile is in '_<mark style="color:green;">Resolved Claim</mark>_' status.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**WARNING**: Vouching for someone means you know the person, that you are sure that they are not fake or impersonators and that you checked that their submitted information was correct (ex: the address in the video is correct and readable).\
You could get removed from the registry if you vouched for a duplicate or fake submission.\
\
You will not get removed if you vouch for a profile with simply incorrect information.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-02 at 1.24.24 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you meet these conditions, go to the profile page of the person you want to vouch for (they can share the link or you can search for their exact name in the search bar) and click on the '<mark style="color:orange;">Vouch</mark>' button on their profile.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-02 at 1.26.20 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once your vouching transaction is validated, your profile will appear in the 'Vouched by' list.

{% hint style="info" %}
**How many vouches can I give in parallel?**

You can vouch for as many people as you would like. However, your vouch will only count for one person at a time in the order they were given. This means a vouch can only be used for one submission at a time on a “first come, first served” basis.

For example, assume user A is registered. A vouches for user B. User B uses the vouch and moves to '_<mark style="color:blue;">Pending Claim</mark>_' phase. Then A vouches for user C. Since the vouching of A is already in use by B, C remains in the '_<mark style="color:purple;">Vouching</mark>_' phase for now, but will move to '_<mark style="color:blue;">Pending Claim</mark>_' phase once B is registered.
{% endhint %}

You can remove your vouch at any time prior to the '_<mark style="color:blue;">Pending Claim</mark>_' phase by going to the vouched person's profile and clicking on '<mark style="color:orange;">Remove Vouch</mark>'.
