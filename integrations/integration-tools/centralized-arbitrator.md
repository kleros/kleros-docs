# Centralized Arbitrator

🔨 [Centralized Arbitrator](https://centralizedarbitrator.kleros.io)** **🔨\
\
The **Centralized Arbitrator** dashboard allows anyone to quickly deploy and operate a centralized arbitrator from a graphical user interface. This serves as a quick demonstration tool and can help to debug arbitrable apps trying to integrate with Kleros Court as an arbitrator.

## How does it work?

* You start by accessing the [dashboard](https://centralizedarbitrator.kleros.io) and connecting with a Metamask wallet set to the correct network you want to test on.

{% hint style="info" %}
**NETWORK COMPATIBILITY: **\
The Centralized Arbitrator can be used on:

* Ethereum Mainnet
* Ethereum Kovan
* Ethereum Ropsten
* _(You can request new testnet support to Kleros team)_
{% endhint %}

* Then, you choose between:
  * Deploying a new centralized arbitrator
    * Your current Ethereum address will be the owner and will be able to set rulings.
    * You have to set an arbitration fee amount that can be modified later on.
  * Selecting an already deployed centralized arbitrator
    * by inputting its address in the relevant field
    * or selecting it in the dropdown list if you already used it locally.

* On the list below, you will be able to track incoming disputes from arbitrable apps, filter them by status and give rulings directly from the interface.
