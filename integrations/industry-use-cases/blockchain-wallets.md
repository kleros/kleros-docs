# Blockchain wallets

## Key challenges

With the number of smart contract exploits and hacks getting higher than ever, it is more important than ever to be able to provide wallet users with reliable and meaningful contract information before they perform any transaction.&#x20;

The number of deployed smart contracts on Ethereum alone number in the millions, and wallet providers often have have to rely on data sources sourced from centralized parties, or turn to crowd-sourced but insecure public lists.&#x20;

Kleros solves this problem with it's fully trustless and permissionless data registries built specially for blockchain wallets.

## **How Kleros can be used**

[**Kleros Curate**](../../products/curate/) has been used to construct several fully trustless and permissionless token curated registries (TCRs). The data is crowdsourced and secured using submission deposits to ensure that the data on the list is correct.

### [Kleros Tokens](../../products/tokens/)

This is a list of over a thousand (and growing) fungible tokens. Additional verification badges are given to certain tokens which have met a more stringent set of criteria (e.g. ERC-20 compliance, stablecoin status).

### [Kleros Address tags](https://blog.kleros.io/the-kleros-decentralized-tag-registry-a-proof-of-concept-for-securing-web3/)

This is a list of [contract address tags](https://curate.kleros.io/tcr/100/0x76944a2678A0954A610096Ee78E8CEB8d46d5922) on the Ethereum blockchain that can be used to show users the labels of the contracts they are interacting with. _(Other chains coming soon.)_

### Kleros Address tags with domain names (coming soon)

This is a list of address tags along with the domain name that the contract belongs to, useful for browser-based wallets that need to check domain-contract mappings to protect users against DNS and frontend attacks.

## Integration options

### Subgraph endpoints

Retrieve the data from the above registries using the subgraph endpoints on this page:
