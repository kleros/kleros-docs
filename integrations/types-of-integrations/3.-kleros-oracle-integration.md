  A comprehensive guide for integrating Reality.eth + Kleros oracle system to
  access reliable real-world data through decentralized verification and
  arbitration.

# 3. Kleros Oracle integration

### Introduction

Want your DApp to access reliable real-world information on-chain? The Reality.eth + Kleros oracle system provides a decentralized solution for subjective data verification through economic incentives and crowdsourced arbitration.

This system combines two key protocols:

* [Reality.eth](https://reality.eth.limo/) - The underlying oracle and bond escalation mechanism
* [Kleros](https://court.kleros.io/) - The dispute resolution protocol



### How It Works

The integration consists of two main parts:

1.  **Your DApp**

    Your DApp only needs to interact with the Reality.eth contract directly

    * You submit questions with the appropriate arbitrator address
    * You retrieve final answers once they're available
    * No need to implement any arbitration logic in your code
2. **Oracle System**
   * The oracle system handles everything else behind the scenes:
   * Reality.eth: Manages questions, answers, and economic incentives through bond escalation
   * Arbitration Mechanism: When disputes arise, the Kleros Arbitrator Proxy creates a case in Kleros Court where jurors resolve the dispute, then reports the result back to Reality.eth

{% hint style="info" %}
This separation means your integration is simple - you only need to know how to ask questions and retrieve answers from Reality.eth.
{% endhint %}

### Integration Options

You have two ways to integrate with the Reality.eth + Kleros oracle:

#### 1. Offchain Integration (Quick Testing)

Use the [Reality.eth web interface](https://reality.eth.limo/) to submit questions and retrieve answers manually. This is ideal for:

* Testing the system before full integration, learning how the system works
* One-off questions that don't require automation

#### 2. Onchain Integration (Production)

Implement direct smart contract interaction with Reality.eth to programmatically:

* Submit questions from your DApp
* Retrieve verified answers
* React to oracle responses

{% hint style="info" %}
For this approach, you'll need to thoroughly understand the Reality.eth interface. Check out the [official Reality.eth documentation](https://reality.eth.limo/app/docs/html/) and  [Reality github](https://github.com/RealityETH/reality-eth-monorepo)
{% endhint %}

### Resolution Flow

The Reality.eth + Kleros system follows a push/pull model:

1. **Push**: Your DApp submits questions to Reality.eth
2. **Pull**: Your DApp later retrieves the verified answers

The question can be resolved through two paths:

#### Happy Path: Consensus Resolution

1. Someone submits an answer with a bond
2. No one challenges within the timeout period
3. The answer is finalized automatically
4. Your DApp can retrieve the result

#### Unhappy Path: Arbitration Resolution

1. Someone submits an answer with a bond
2. Another user challenges with a higher bond
3. Bond escalation may continue until someone requests arbitration
4. The question gets frozen on Reality.eth
5. A dispute is created in Kleros Court
6. Evidence submission period begins
7. Jurors vote on the correct answer
8. The final ruling is submitted to Reality.eth
9. Your DApp can retrieve the arbitrated result

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important**: All interactions occur through the Reality.eth interface - you don't need to build separate interfaces for these different resolution paths.
{% endhint %}

### Quick Start Guide

#### Step 1: Configure Your DApp

Your DApp only needs to interact with Reality.eth directly. Import the interface:



```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./IRealityETH.sol";

contract MyDApp {
    IRealityETH public realityETH;
    
    constructor(address _realityETHAddress) {
        realityETH = IRealityETH(_realityETHAddress);
    }
    
    // The rest of your contract...
}
```

You can find the Reality.eth contract addresses under:

[https://github.com/RealityETH/reality-eth-monorepo/tree/main/packages/contracts/chains/deployments](https://github.com/RealityETH/reality-eth-monorepo/tree/main/packages/contracts/chains/deployments)

#### Step 2: Ask Questions

To submit a question to Reality.eth:

```solidity
function askQuestion(
    uint256 templateID,
    string calldata question,
    address arbitrator,
    uint32 timeout,
    uint32 openingTimestamp,
    uint256 nonce
) external payable returns (bytes32 questionID) {
    // Choose the appropriate Kleros arbitrator proxy address for your network
    address arbitrator = 0xFf32eff53459485074b4Db14633252C9dcA3791A;// Example: Mainnet General Court
    
    // Any ETH sent with this transaction becomes the question reward
    return realityETH.askQuestion{value: msg.value}(
        templateID,
        question,
        arbitrator,
        timeout,
        openingTimestamp,
        nonce
    );
}
```

**Parameter Explanations:**

* **templateID**: The question format template - commonly used values:
  * `0`: Boolean (Yes/No) questions
  * `1`: Numerical (uint) answers
  * `2`: Single-select multiple choice
  * `3`: Multiple-select multiple choice
  * `4`: Datetime responses
  * `5`: Hash type (new in v3.2)
* **question**: The actual question with parameters matching the template format, separated by the unicode delimiter "␟":
  * Template 0 (bool): `"Did event X happen?␟category␟en"`
  * Template 1 (uint): `"What was the price of ETH on April 16, 2025?␟crypto␟en"`
  * Template 2 (single-select): `"Which team won the 2024 NBA Finals?␟"Lakers","Celtics","Bucks","Other"␟sports␟en"`
* **arbitrator**: **arbitrator**: The address of the Kleros Arbitrator Proxy that will handle disputes.
* **timeout**: Time in seconds the question will have after receiving an answer before it's automatically finalized. Typically around 1 day (86400 seconds). The contract enforces a maximum value of 365 days (31,536,000 seconds).
* **openingTimestamp**: Unix timestamp defining the earliest time when answers can be submitted. Set to 0 if you want the question to be answerable immediately.
* **nonce**: A user-supplied number to differentiate between identical questions with the same settings. Use 0 if you don't plan to ask the same question with identical parameters more than once.

**Example**

```solidity
// Ask with a 0.1 ETH reward
bytes32 questionID = realityETH.askQuestion{value: 0.1 ether}(
    0, // Boolean template
    "Did the S&P 500 close above 5000 on April 16, 2025?␟finance␟en",
    arbitratorAddress,
    86400, // 24 hour timeout
    0, // Answerable immediately
    0 // Default nonce
);
```

#### Official Arbitrator Proxy Addresses

The system supports same chain and cross-chain deployments (question on one chain, arbitration on another).&#x20;

* **Same-chain oracle and arbitration**:
  * **Ethereum Mainnet (General Court)**: `0xFf32eff53459485074b4Db14633252C9dcA3791A`
  * **Ethereum Mainnet (DAO Governance/Technical Court)**: `0xf72cfd1b34a91a64f9a98537fe63fbab7530adca`
  * **Sepolia Testnet**: `0x05b942faecfb3924970e3a28e0f230910cedff45`



* **Cross-chain oracle and arbitration**:&#x20;
  * Question and arbitration on different chains, aka cross-chain proxies: list of deployments [here](https://github.com/kleros/cross-chain-realitio-proxy/tree/master/contracts#deployments).



#### Step 3: Retrieve Answers

Once your question has been answered (either through consensus or arbitration), retrieve the answer:

```solidity
function getAnswer(bytes32 questionID) external view returns (bytes32) {
    // This will revert if the question is not finalized
    return realityETH.resultFor(questionID);
}

// For safer access that won't revert:
function isQuestionFinalized(bytes32 questionID) external view returns (bool) {
    try realityETH.resultFor(questionID) returns (bytes32) {
        return true;
    } catch {
        return false;
    }

```

### Evidence Submission for Disputes&#x20;

When a Reality.eth question goes to arbitration, there's a crucial evidence submission period where parties can provide supporting materials to help jurors make informed decisions.

#### Understanding the Evidence Timeline

1. **Question Posted**: Your question is submitted to Reality.eth
2. **Answer Phase**: Users submit answers with bonds
3. **Arbitration Requested**: Someone pays the arbitration fee to dispute an answer
4. **Evidence Period Begins**: A window opens for submitting evidence (typically 3-7 days)
5. **Voting Phase**: Kleros jurors review evidence and vote
6. **Final Ruling**: The decision is reported back to Reality.eth

#### How to Submit Evidence

Evidence submission happens through the Kleros Arbitrator Proxy contract, **not** through Reality.eth directly.

**Method 1: Smart Contract Integration**

```solidity
// Import the arbitrator proxy interface
interface IKlerosArbitratorProxy {
    function submitEvidence(
        uint256 _questionID, 
        string calldata _evidenceURI
    ) external;
}

contract MyDApp {
    IKlerosArbitratorProxy public arbitratorProxy;
    
    constructor(address _arbitratorProxyAddress) {
        arbitratorProxy = IKlerosArbitratorProxy(_arbitratorProxyAddress);
    }
    
    function submitEvidenceForQuestion(
        bytes32 questionID,
        string calldata evidenceURI
    ) external {
        // Convert questionID to uint256 for the arbitrator proxy
        uint256 questionIDUint = uint256(questionID);
        
        arbitratorProxy.submitEvidence(questionIDUint, evidenceURI);
    }
}
```

**Method 2: Direct Contract Call**

You can also submit evidence directly by calling the arbitrator proxy contract:

```solidity
// Call submitEvidence on the proxy contract
arbitratorProxy.submitEvidence(
    uint256(questionID), 
    "/ipfs/QmYourEvidenceHash"
);
```

#### Evidence Format and Best Practices

**Evidence URI Requirements:**

* Must be a publicly accessible URL
* IPFS links are recommended for decentralization:  `/ipfs/QmHash`  or `ipfs://QmHash`
* Can also use traditional web hosting, but permanence is important

**Evidence Content Guidelines:**

Evidence should follow the ERC-1497 standard format:\


```json
{
  "fileURI": "/ipfs/QmScreenshotHash",
  "fileHash": "QmScreenshotHash", 
  "name": "Evidence Supporting Yes",
  "description": "Official S&P website showing closing price of 5,127.43",
  "fileTypeExtension": "png"
}
```

**For Supporting a "Yes" Answer:**

```json
{
  "fileURI": "/ipfs/QmScreenshotHash",
  "fileHash": "QmScreenshotHash",
  "name": "Evidence Supporting Yes",
  "description": "Proof that the S&P 500 closed above 5000 on April 16, 2025 - Official S&P website showing closing price of 5,127.43",
  "fileTypeExtension": "png"
}
```

**For Supporting a "No" Answer:**

```json
{
  "fileURI": "/ipfs/QmCounterScreenshotHash", 
  "fileHash": "QmCounterScreenshotHash",
  "name": "Evidence Supporting No",
  "description": "Proof that the S&P 500 did NOT close above 5000 on April 16, 2025 - Official S&P website showing closing price of 4,987.22",
  "fileTypeExtension": "png"
}
```

#### Multiple Evidence Submissions

* **Anyone can submit evidence** during the evidence period
* **Multiple submissions are allowed** - you can submit additional evidence as you find it
* **Both sides should submit** - supporters of different answers should provide their evidence
* **Quality over quantity** - clear, authoritative evidence is more valuable than numerous weak sources

#### Evidence Timing

* Evidence periods length varies by court configuration
* Check the specific arbitrator proxy settings for exact timing
* Submit evidence **as early as possible** - don't wait until the last minute
* Evidence can be submitted until the dispute moves to the voting phase

#### Monitoring Evidence Submission

You can monitor when evidence periods open by watching for events:

```solidity
// Listen for Dispute events from the arbitrator proxy
event Dispute(
    IArbitrator indexed _arbitrator,
    uint256 indexed _disputeID,
    uint256 _metaEvidenceID,
    uint256 _evidenceGroupID
);

// Listen for Evidence events to see what others have submitted
event Evidence(
    IArbitrator indexed _arbitrator,
    uint256 indexed _evidenceGroupID,
    address indexed _party,
    string _evidence
);
```

### Technical Details

#### Reality.eth + Kleros Arbitrator Proxy

The Kleros Arbitrator Proxy:

* Acts as an arbitrator for Reality.eth
* Creates disputes in Kleros Court when arbitration is requested
* Reports Kleros rulings back to Reality.eth in the proper format

#### Kleros Court

The Kleros Court:

* Adjudicates on disputes by drawing jurors
* Manages the crowdfunded appeals process
* Publishes final rulings that are transmitted back to Reality.eth

### Working with the Kleros Oracle System

#### Question Types and Templates

The Reality.eth + Kleros oracle supports various question types:

| Type            | Description                                    | Example                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Bool            | Yes/No questions                               | Did event X happen?                     |
| Uint            | Numerical answers                              | How many votes did candidate Y receive? |
| Single-select   | Multiple choice with one answer                | Which team won the championship?        |
| Multiple-select | Multiple choice with multiple possible answers | Which states voted Democrat?            |
| Datetime        | Date/time responses                            | When did the event occur?               |
| Hash            | Hash-based identification (new in v3.2)        | Does hash X correspond to document Y?   |



Questions use templates to reduce gas costs. Built-in templates include:

```
[ ]

0: {"title": "%s", "type": "bool", "category": "%s", "lang": "%s"}
1: {"title": "%s", "type": "uint", "decimals": 18, "category": "%s", "lang": "%s"}
2: {"title": "%s", "type": "single-select", "outcomes": [%s], "category": "%s", "lang": "%s"}
3: {"title": "%s", "type": "multiple-select", "outcomes": [%s], "category": "%s", "lang": "%s"}
4: {"title": "%s", "type": "datetime", "category": "%s", "lang": "%s"}

```

\
You can create custom templates with `createTemplate()` or use the [Reality.eth Template Generator](https://reality.eth.link/app/template-generator).

#### Interpreting Results

Responses are returned as `bytes32`. Depending on the question type:

* **Bool**: `1` (Yes), `0` (No), or `0xff...ff` (Invalid)
* **Uint**: The number as bytes32, divided by `decimals` if specified
* **Single-select**: Zero-indexed selection (0 for first option, 1 for second, etc.)
* **Multiple-select**: One-indexed with bitwise addition (1 for first, 2 for second, 1+2=3 for both)
* **Datetime**: Unix timestamp (seconds since 1970)
* **Hash:** The submitted hash that matches the criteria

Special values you may encounter:

* `0xff...ff` (all f's): Invalid answer
* `0xff...fe` (all f's except last digit): "Answered too early" - when a question needs more time

### Fees and Payments

The Reality.eth + Kleros system involves several types of fees and payments, each with a specific purpose in the incentive mechanism:

| **Fee type**    | **Set by**        | **Paid by**                   | **Deductions**      | **Paid to**                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Question Reward | Asker             | Asker                         | None                | Highest-bonded correct answerer\*                             |
| Answer Bond     | Answerer          | Answerer                      | None                | Returned if correct, or to next correct answerer if incorrect |
| Takeover Fee    | Previous answerer | Subsequent answerer           | From answer rewards | Previous answerer                                             |
| Arbitration Fee | Arbitrator        | Anyone requesting arbitration | None                | Arbitrator                                                    |
| Claim Fee       | System (2.5%)     | Claimer                       | From claimed amount | Burned                                                        |

\*Except when settled by arbitration

#### Question Reward

* Set by sending ETH when calling `askQuestion()`
* Any ETH or tokens provided with the askQuestion or askQuestionERC20 call will be used as a question reward, minus any fee the specified arbitrator requires when a new question is asked
* Incentivizes correct answers
* Paid to whoever provides the final accepted answer
* If decided by arbitration, the arbitrator specifies who receives the reward
* Higher rewards typically result in faster and more accurate answers

#### Answer Bond

* Backs the answerer's claim that their answer is correct
* Set by the answerer, but must be at least twice the previous bond if there was a prior answer
* Returned if the answer is correct
* If incorrect, paid to the next answerer who supplies the correct answer

#### Answer Takeover Fee

* Compensates previous answerers when someone takes over a correct answer
* Equal to the bond supplied by the last person who gave that answer
* Paid to the last person who gave that answer
* Deducted from payments that would otherwise be awarded for giving the correct answer

#### Arbitration Fee

* Paid to the arbitrator when requesting intervention
* Set by the arbitrator
* Paid by the user requesting arbitration (usually an answerer whose answer was replaced)

#### Claim Fee

* From Reality.eth v2.1 onwards
* 2.5% of claimed bonds (except the final bond) is burned

### Kleros Oracle in Production

* **Prediction Markets**: Seer, Polkamarkets/Foreland, and Omen use it to verify real-world event outcomes
* **Optimistic Governance**:  [Zodiac SafeSnap module](https://docs.kleros.io/integrations/types-of-integrations/1.-dispute-resolution-integration-plan/channel-partners/kleros-reality-module#safesnap) implements it for secure DAO proposal execution
* **Content Moderation**: [Moderate/Susie bot](https://kleros.io/moderate) leverages it for decentralized content policy enforcement

### Advanced Topics

#### Custom Primary Document for Arbitration

For most DApp integrations, the standard [general document](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmaUr6hnSVxYD899xdcn2GUVtXVjXoSXKZbce3zFtGWw4H/Question_Resolution_Policy.pdf) works perfectly fine without any customization. However, in some specialized cases, you may need a custom primary document for arbitration.

**When Is This Required?**

A custom primary document becomes necessary when:

1. Your DApp has specific rules for how disputes should be judged
2. Resolving disputes requires specialized knowledge or context
3. You need a dedicated Kleros court for your application's disputes
4. The interpretation of answers in your context differs from standard interpretations

**The Complete Scenario**

If you need a custom primary document:

1. **Initial Assessment**: The Kleros team evaluates your use case to determine if standard arbitration guidelines are sufficient
2. **Document Creation**: You work with Kleros to create a document that:
   * Explains your application's context to jurors
   * Provides guidance on evaluating evidence
   * Defines specialized terminology
   * Establishes clear criteria for determining correct answers
3. **Deployment**: Kleros deploys a dedicated arbitrator proxy for your application with your primary document embedded as part of the proxy's metaevidence
4. **Usage**: When disputes go to arbitration, jurors use your guidelines to make decisions

**Real-World Example: Seer Prediction Markets**

Seer required a [custom primary document](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPmRkXFUmzP4rq2YfD3wNwL8bg3WDxkYuvTP9A9UZm9gJ/seer-markets-resolution-policy.pdf) because they needed specific rules for handling complex market outcomes, edge cases like delayed events, and wanted to specify which information sources should be considered authoritative for their prediction markets.

If you think your application might need this level of customization, the Kleros team can guide you through the process.

### Common Questions

**Q: Does my DApp need to call the arbitrator proxy directly?**

A: No! Your DApp only needs to interact with Reality.eth. The proxy handles communication between Reality.eth and Kleros.

**Q: What happens if there's a dispute?**

A: The dispute process is handled automatically between Reality.eth and Kleros via the arbitrator proxy.

**Q: How can I make my question clearer for accurate answers?**

A: Be specific, include resolution criteria, and specify a trusted information source if applicable. For example: "Did the S\&P 500 close above 5,000 on April 10, 2025, according to the official S\&P website?"

**Q: If I don't want to use the Reality.eth frontend for my users, can I handle everything from my DApp**

A: Yes, you can implement the full flow in your DApp, including submitting questions, providing answers, and requesting arbitration as needed.
