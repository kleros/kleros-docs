# Types of Integrations

While there are [numerous ways](../live-and-upcoming-integrations.md) to make use of Kleros, but they can be broadly put into two categories:

1. [Using Kleros to **resolve disputes**](1.-dispute-resolution-integration-plan/)
2. [Reading and using **curated data** from public on-chain registries secured by Kleros Court](2.-curated-data-integration-plan/)
3. [Using Kleros **oracle services** to obtain verified real-world information for your DApp](3.-kleros-oracle-integration.md)
