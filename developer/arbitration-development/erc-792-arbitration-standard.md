# ERC-792: Arbitration Standard

### Abstract

The ERC-792 - Arbitration Standard describes a standard of `Arbitrable` and `Arbitrator` contracts. Every Arbitrable contract can be adjudicated by every Arbitrator contract. Arbitrator contracts give rulings and Arbitrable contracts enforce them.

### Motivation

Using two contracts allows separation between the ruling and its enforcement. This abstraction allows `Arbitrable` contract developers not to have to know the internal process of the `Arbitrator` contracts. Neither do `Arbitrator` contract developers with `Arbitrable` ones.\
It allows dapps to easily switch from one arbitration service to another one. Or to allow their users to choose themselves their arbitration services.

 * - Define the functions for cost display (arbitrationCost and appealCost).
 * - Allow giving rulings. For this a function must call arbitrable.rule(disputeID, ruling).

{% hint style="info" %}
The `extraData` is a byte array that is used to provide additional information about a dispute in a smart contract system. It consists of 64 bytes in total. The byte array is divided into two parts:

1. ID of the subcourt (32 bytes): The first 32 bytes of the `extraData` array are dedicated to storing the ID of the subcourt where the dispute will be created. The subcourt ID is represented by a `uint96` data type. Subcourt IDs can be found on [this page](https://klerosboard.com/1/courts).
2. Minimum number of jurors required (32 bytes): The next 32 bytes of the `extraData` array are reserved for specifying the minimum number of jurors that are required for the dispute. This value is represented by a `uint` data type. The minimum number required for most disputes is usually 3.

By passing the `extraData` array to a relevant function (such as the `arbitrationCost` and `createDispute` functions), the subcourt ID and the minimum number of jurors can be extracted and utilized for further operations within the Arbitrator's smart contract.

In the linked documentation, you will be guided through the usage of this standard. We will implement some examples for `Arbitrable` and `Arbitrator` contracts.
